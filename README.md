# Seasons

A season-aware neobrutalist theme for your blog, built with [Astro](https://astro.build/) and Tailwind CSS. The palette follows the calendar, with a light and a dark mode for every season. See the [screenshots](#seasonal-theme) below.

## Create a project from this template

Generate a new project from this repository with the Astro CLI. Use the package manager you prefer:

```sh
npm create astro@latest -- my-site --template nicomiguelino/astro-seasons
pnpm create astro@latest my-site --template nicomiguelino/astro-seasons
bun create astro@latest my-site --template nicomiguelino/astro-seasons
```

To use a specific branch or tag, append it to the template name: `--template nicomiguelino/astro-seasons#branch-name`.

The CLI copies the template, offers to install dependencies, and offers to initialize a git repository. Accept the git prompt (or run `git init` yourself before `npm install`) so the Husky pre-commit hook gets set up.

The template ships a `package-lock.json`. If you use another package manager, delete it and let your package manager generate its own lockfile. The scripts below work with any of them (for example `pnpm run dev` or `bun run dev`).

After generating:

1. Replace the placeholders in `src/lib/site.ts` (`SITE_NAME`, `AUTHOR_NAME`, `SITE_URL`, `GITHUB_URL`, and so on). `astro.config.mjs` reads `SITE_URL` from there.
2. Set `SOURCE_URL` in `src/lib/site.ts` to the repository that builds your site (see [License](#license)).
3. If you deploy to a sub-path (a GitHub Pages project page at `https://<user>.github.io/<repo>/`), see [Deploying under a sub-path](#deploying-under-a-sub-path).
4. Replace the example posts in `src/content/blog/` and the pages under `src/pages/` (such as `experience/` and `projects/`) with your own content.

Prefer to work from a clone? Run `git clone https://github.com/nicomiguelino/astro-seasons.git` and follow the steps below.

## Getting started

Install the dependencies and run the project:

```sh
npm install
npm run dev           # dev server on :4321
npm run build         # production build
npm run preview       # preview the production build
npm run check         # astro type checking
npm run lint:check    # lint with ESLint
npm run lint:fix      # lint and apply safe fixes
npm run format:check  # check formatting with Prettier
npm run format:fix    # format files with Prettier
npm run test:e2e      # Playwright E2E and screenshot tests
```

> [!NOTE]
> `npm install` also sets up a Husky pre-commit hook that runs `lint:check`, `format:check`, and `check`. Fix failures before committing.

## Seasonal theme

The site switches palettes by date. Every family has a light and a dark variant, defined in `src/styles/palettes.css`:

- `neon-*`: not tied to a date, only available from the theme picker
- `autumn-*`: used from Sept 22 to Dec 21
- `winter-*`: used from Dec 22 to Mar 19
- `spring-*`: used from Mar 20 to Jun 20
- `summer-*`: used from Jun 21 to Sept 21

|        | Light                                              | Dark                                             |
| ------ | -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Autumn | ![Autumn light](screenshots/home-autumn-light.png) | ![Autumn dark](screenshots/home-autumn-dark.png) |
| Winter | ![Winter light](screenshots/home-winter-light.png) | ![Winter dark](screenshots/home-winter-dark.png) |
| Spring | ![Spring light](screenshots/home-spring-light.png) | ![Spring dark](screenshots/home-spring-dark.png) |
| Summer | ![Summer light](screenshots/home-summer-light.png) | ![Summer dark](screenshots/home-summer-dark.png) |

How it works:

- The family is picked from the visitor's local date on every page load, so no rebuild is needed when a season starts or ends.
- The mode (light or dark) comes from the theme toggle, falling back to `prefers-color-scheme`. Only the mode is stored (`site-mode` in `localStorage`), so a saved preference carries across seasons.
- The legacy `site-palette` value is migrated to `site-mode` and removed.
- `initializePalette()` in `src/lib/palette.ts` sets `data-palette` on `<html>`. `Layout.astro` calls it from `<head>`, and `body` stays hidden until the attribute is set (visible when scripting is off) to avoid a flash of the wrong colors.
- The theme toggle switches between light and dark within the active family.
- The theme picker in the navbar (before the light/dark toggle) overrides the date: Automatic (follow the date, the default), Autumn, Winter, Spring, Summer (under a "Seasons" divider), or Neon (under an "Other" divider). The choice is stored in `localStorage` as `site-theme` (removed for Automatic), and the matching falling effect follows it.

Autumn, winter and spring each have a falling effect on the home page (`FallingLeaves`, `FallingSnow`, `FallingPetals`). Summer has two ambient effects instead: `HeatShimmer` (an SVG displacement filter that makes the page content shimmer) and `Sunlight` (a pulsing warm glow in the top-right corner). Every effect is shown only under its palettes and when `prefers-reduced-motion` allows it.

To change the dates, edit `seasons` in `PALETTE_CONFIG` (`MMDD` numbers, inclusive; a range with `start` after `end` wraps the new year). To add a season, add it to `THEME_CHOICES` and the picker options in `src/components/header/ThemePicker.astro`, then add `[data-palette='<name>-light']` and `<name>-dark` blocks to `palettes.css`, add its name to `PaletteFamily`, and add its range to `seasons`.

To preview a season, set it in the browser console, e.g. `document.documentElement.dataset.palette = 'autumn-dark'`.

## Testing

Tests use [Playwright](https://playwright.dev) and live in `src/tests/`:

- `src/tests/e2e/`: behavior checks, e.g. the home page title and which falling particles show in each season
- `src/tests/screenshots/`: captures the home, blog, blog post, experience, projects, tags and 404 pages in light and dark, one spec per page
- `src/tests/fixtures/blog/`: fixture posts the Playwright build uses in place of the real ones

Set up once per machine:

```sh
npx playwright install chromium
```

Then run the tests. Playwright builds the site and serves it with `astro preview` on port 4322, so it never collides with the dev server on :4321:

```sh
npm run test:e2e                                        # everything
npx playwright test src/tests/e2e                       # E2E only
npx playwright test src/tests/screenshots               # screenshots only
npx playwright test --ui                                # interactive runner
npx playwright show-report                              # open the last HTML report
```

### Screenshots

- Each of those pages is captured at 1920x1200 in light and dark. The home page is captured once for each season, and the other pages in summer only.
- The clock is pinned (July 15 for summer, Oct 15 for autumn, Jan 15 for winter, Apr 15 for spring), so results don't depend on today's date.
- `falling-particles` captures the home page with the falling effects frozen mid-fall (autumn, winter and spring; summer has no particles), since the other screenshots disable animations and so hide the particles. Names look like `falling-particles-autumn-dark.png`.
- The color scheme is emulated with `prefers-color-scheme`.
- Content is pinned too. The Playwright build sets `USE_FIXTURE_POSTS`, which makes the content collection in `src/content.config.ts` load the posts in `src/tests/fixtures/blog/` instead of `src/content/blog/`. Adding or editing a real post leaves `screenshots/` unchanged, and `blog-post` points at `/blog/fixture-post-one/`.
- Fixture posts have fixed titles, tags, and dates. Edit them only when a screenshot should change, and keep a word like "tool" in one of them, since the search E2E spec queries it.
- Screenshots are written to `screenshots/` (overwriting the previous ones) and are not part of the deployed site. Names look like `home-autumn-dark.png` and `blog-post-summer-dark.png`.
- They are captured, not compared, so the tests don't fail on visual changes. Review the images in `git diff` before committing.
- To capture another page, create `src/tests/screenshots/<page>.spec.ts` that calls `defineScreenshotTests('<page>', '/<path>/')` from `./support`. Pass `[SUMMER_SEASON, AUTUMN_SEASON, WINTER_SEASON, SPRING_SEASON]` as a third argument to cover every palette.

The `Checks` workflow runs lint, format, and E2E as parallel jobs after a shared dependency setup, on pushes and pull requests to `main`. It can also be started manually.

## Deploying under a sub-path

Served from the root of a domain (a `<user>.github.io` repository or a custom domain), the site needs no extra setup. Served from a sub-path (a GitHub Pages project page at `https://<user>.github.io/<repo>/`), set two environment variables at build time:

```sh
SITE_URL=https://<user>.github.io BASE_PATH=/<repo> npm run build
```

`astro.config.mjs` passes them to Astro's `site` and `base` options. With neither set, the build is for a domain root. `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` sets both from the repository owner and name and deploys to GitHub Pages. To use it for your own copy, remove the `if: github.repository == ...` line, then set **Settings > Pages > Source** to **GitHub Actions**.

Astro's `base` only rewrites URLs that Astro generates itself (stylesheets, scripts, and fonts referenced from CSS). Root-absolute paths you write by hand are not rewritten, so wrap them with `withBase()` from `src/lib/paths.ts`:

```astro
---
import { withBase } from '@/lib/paths';
---

<a href={withBase('/blog/')}>Blog</a>
```

This applies to `href`, `src`, and `fetch` URLs in `.astro` and `.ts` files. In Markdown, use relative links (for example `../markdown-features/`) so they work under any base. `withBase()` returns the path unchanged when there is no base.

## Customizing

Site-wide values (site name, author name, description, job title, site URL, the GitHub and LinkedIn profile links, and the blog, tags, experience, and projects page descriptions) live in `src/lib/site.ts`. The header, footer, page titles, RSS feed, search, and structured data all read from it, and the letter in the header logo is the first character of `SITE_NAME`. Everything else to customize:

- `src/components/header/index.astro` and `src/components/layout/Footer.astro`: navigation, header icons, footer
- `src/pages/index.astro`: the home page heading and the intro card
- `src/components/experience/` and `src/pages/experience/index.astro`: the experience page. Each job is one component built on `ExperienceEntry.astro`. Rename, edit, or add components, then list them in `src/components/experience/index.astro`
- `src/components/projects/` and `src/lib/projects.ts`: the projects page. Edit the `projects` array in `index.astro` (name, description, technologies, and a `links` array of `{ kind, url }`, with an optional `isCooking` flag), add link kinds in `src/lib/projects.ts`, and update the matching body in `src/lib/search.ts`
- `src/lib/search.ts`: the search entries for the static pages (home, blog, tags, experience, projects). Their descriptions come from `site.ts`, but the home, experience, and projects bodies are plain text, so update them when you change those pages
- `public/favicon.svg`: the tab icon, a static file that doesn't follow `SITE_NAME`, so replace it with your own
- `src/lib/palette.ts`: the seasonal palette logic and its config (storage keys, season dates); see [Seasonal theme](#seasonal-theme)
- `src/lib/colors.ts`: the color tokens listed on the `/colors/` page; add a token here when you add one to `src/styles/palettes.css`
- `public/robots.txt`: the sitemap URL (a static file, so it can't import from `site.ts`). Crawlers only read `robots.txt` at the root of a domain, so it has no effect on a sub-path deploy
- `public/assets/og.png`: social preview image, 1200x630. It's a screenshot of the autumn home page, so replace it with your own

## Writing posts

Posts are markdown files in `src/content/blog/` with `title`, `description`, `date`, optional `tags`, and optional `draft` frontmatter. Each tag links to its archive page under `/tags/`. `markdown-features.md` shows the frontmatter and every supported markdown feature, and `make-it-yours.md` is a short customization guide. Delete both when you add your own posts.
